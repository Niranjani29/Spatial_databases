# Spatial_databases
Create (generate/sample) some data, visualize it, do queries on it, and visualize the query results.

1. I have collected latitude,longitude pairs (ie. spatial coordinates) for 15 locations, in the University of Southern California campus (UPC). I have collected them under 3 categories(5 each) - Prks, Cafes, Libraries

2. Now that I have 15 coordinates and their labels and categories, I am going to create a KML file (.kml format, which is XML) . Specifically, each location will be a 'placemark' in your .kml file (with a label, and coords), under three groups/categories. I have visualized it as follows :
